SECOND DRAFT.

# First Act - Saatvik to Saarish - best friend but not a soul mate.
## Bitter is better. Meet Saatvik and Prema.

>FADE IN:

A young woman's unbridled laughter. A laughter to fall in love with.

INT. SAATVIK'S HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

A young woman's slender hand slices a lemon in half. Manicured but devoid of nail polish or adornments.

PREMA laughs as SAATVIK narrates a funny incident. They are in their mid-twenties. Wearing shorts, he looks like a young Sundar Pichai(Google CEO) with an amicable smile.

She is as pretty as her laughter and toned like an athlete. She never wears makeup. She doesn't need it.

An upper middle class kitchen decked with expensive appliances. This is Saatvik's home.

She slices a lemon as he takes out two beers out of the refrigerator and puts them on the counter.

She squeezes lemon into the beer bottle. She was about to squeeze the lemon into the other beer bottle, Saatvik pulls it away.

SAATVIK
vaddu. vaddu. lemon vaddu.

PREMA
No. No. baagu.mTadi.

He shakes his head.

SAATVIK
taste i.mka bitter avuddi.

PREMA
e.m kaadu.

He holds the beer closer but she grabs the beer from him anyway.
He makes a face as she squeezes lemon into his bottle.

PREMA
Bitter is good for you. chedu parama auShadha.m annAru.

She extends the bottle back to him. They clink.

SAATVIK
Cheers.

She takes a sip but he PRETENDS to take a sip but doesn't sip.

PREMA
elA u.mdi?

Saatvik struggles to eke out a lie.

SAATVIK
baane u.mdi.

PREMA
ceppaana? naaku telusu neeku naccutu.mdani.

Changing the subject.

SAATVIK
Congratulations once again on the new job.

PREMA
(faux bow)
Thank you, sir. Thank you for this party.
(laughs)
ee job enni rojulu u.mTu.mdo cooddaa.m

SAATVIK
nuvvu evari meeda comment cheyaka pote enni rojulayina u.mTu.mdi. The only purpose of your life is to serve as a warning to others ani boss moha.m mIde cepte Uruku.mTADaa?

She shrugs.

PREMA
nijame cheppaanu kadaa

SAATVIK
cAla ma.mdiki job povaDa.m, paigaa getting fired is a big deal. neekasalu tension e ledu.

PREMA
nuvvu.mDagaa, naake.m tension?

Saatvik smiles as her eyes dance at him.

The door bell chimes breaking the intimate silence.

SAATVIK
Pizza delivery. Can you get it?

As soon as she heads out of the kitchen, Saatvik pours his lemon squeezed beer into the sink and hides the bottle in a cupboard. He takes out a fresh beer out of the refrigerator.

## Power cut while playing soccer.

INT. SAATVIK'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - LATER

CLOSE ON two digital avatars named Saatvik and Prema.  

Imported leather couches. Home decked with state of the art TV and gadgets.

Few empty beer bottles and couple of slices left in the Pizza box on the coffee table.

FIFA Football video game loads on TV.

Holding one game controller, Saatvik extends the other to Prema.

SAATVIK
e.m bet?

Prema chews on a slice.

PREMA
Seriously? Last time experience tarvaata kooDa, i.mka bet cestaava?

SAATVIK
Last time phone valla distract avaDa.m jarigi.mdi madam. a.mduke.

PREMA
(laughing)
saar. Last time I kicked your ass jarigi.mdi.

SAATVIK
Past performance is never an indication of future results.

Saatvik dangles a 500 Rupee note as a bet.

PREMA
ni peru Saatvik ani kaaku.mDa kaamadhenu ani peTTalsi.mdi. You are a gift that keeps on giving.

She rummages through her purse, fishes out a 500 Rupee note and throws into a bowl.

She extends a slice to him but he retracts.

SAATVIK
I am full.

PREMA
okka slice ti.mTene full avutaavaa?

Reluctantly he takes a bite out of the extended slice. 

Game begins on TV. They both are expert gamers.

Moments after intense dribble across the field, Saatvik scores the first goal. He pauses the game and speaks to imaginary spectators.

SAATVIK
ippuDu evaru ass kicking?

PREMA
oy, aapu. raa.

Game resumes.

Within few seconds, Prema scores an equalizer.

PREMA
(nudges him with her elbow)
pilloDa, idi just warm up.

Saatvik's avatar dribbles the ball towards the goal post. As he kicks the ball, his phone rings. He turns to the phone but that distraction is enough for Prema.

She scores her second goal.

He pauses the game and picks up the phone.

SAATVIK
(into the phone)
Yes. This is Saatvik. avunaa? Thank you very munch. naaku telIda.mDi. Free pressure cooker istaaraa? nine percent istunnara? ma.mchi rate laage vu.mdi. cAla tempting offer kaani ... free pressure cooker kosa.m ippuDu i.mkoka illu konAla.mTe ko.mche.m ibba.mdi.
(mouths to an annoyed Prema)
Telemarketer.

She grabs the phone off him.

PREMA
Hey pilla, ee time lo call cestaava? buddu.mda?. nenevarinaa? nee manager kivvu. aaDiki ceptaa nenevaro. Hello. Hello.

The other end hangs up.

PREMA

SAATVIK
paapa.m, raatri kooDa pani cestu.mdi. genuinely hard working person ku no elaa ceptaa.m?

PREMA
--neeku a.mdaru genuine gaane anipistaaru.

Game resumes. Saatvik takes charge.

As he kicks towards the goal post for an equalizer, house plunges into darkness. TV goes blank. Power cut.

SAATVIK
That's...that's a goal.

She shakes her head.

SAATVIK
It counts. It counts. That was a goal. caala clear ga lopalikeltu.mdi.

PREMA

SAATVIK

PREMA

CUT TO:

## Listening to self help, Saatvik drives. A bike cuts him off.

EXT. CITY TRAFFIC - DAY

SAATVIK(V.O)
I attract positive thoughts into my life. I attract positive thoughts into my life. I attract positive thoughts into my life.

INT. CAR - DAY - MOVING

Saatvik drives through the thick traffic repeating the affirmations from a new age self help audiobook playing on his car audio. A USB jumpdrive plugged into the aux port.

SAATVIK
I invite positive events into my life. I invite positive events---

Out of no where, a bike cuts him off. Instinctively Saatvik hits the breaks. 

SAATVIK
Fucker...

Honks from behind.

SAATVIK
(angry)
Ugh. Idiots okka nimisham kooda aaga leru.
(pause)
No negative thoughts. No negative thoughts.

He resumes his affirmations.

## Saarish, welcome back.

INT. FRAUDECTOR OFFICE - DAY

CLOSE ON a photo of a COUPLE in thirties - Neeraj Reddy and Kunthi Reddy. We are looking at a blown-up Times Of India article framed on the wall. The couple in the photo stand behind "Fraudector" logo, smiling. "Perfect couple to put an end to imperfect relations".

We are in a typical IT startup office. Walls are adorned with Fraudector company logos, posters and promotional material. 

Wearing headphones, Saatvik intensely studies the contents of the twin monitors on his desk.

A hand swooshes down infront of the monitor, snaps fingers breaking his attention. He looks up.

SAARISH, his friend and co-worker stands across, smiling. Beneath Saarish's bearded dour face lies a kind soul.

Saatvik smiles and takes off his headphones.

SAATVIK
Hi, welcome back, Saarish.

## Saatvik asks for Saarish details about his recent pelli coopulu.

INT. FRAUDECTOR OFFICE - PANTRY - DAY

Saatvik waits as Saarish dips a tea bag in a cup of hot water.

SAATVIK
(impatient)
Details. Details.

Saarish takes his sweet time to respond. As he finishes his tea making ritual.

SAATVIK
Come on. Details.

SAARISH
(flat as a newsreader)
vaalli.mtikellamu. ammaayini coosaanu. maaTladaanu. Mutton Biriyaani petti.mdi. Biriyaani tinna.m. intikocca.m.

Saarish shrugs.

SAATVIK
deenikanna demonitization lo ekkuva details unnaanyi.

Saarish takes a long sip. Pauses.

SAARISH
Biriyaani tane cesi.mdanta.

SAATVIK
ah, ah?

SAARISH
caala tasty ga vu.mdi.

SAATVIK
You are a vegetarian.

SAARISH
(shakes his head)
Not any more. inni rojulu em miss ayyano ippudu telsi.mdi.

SAATVIK
Forget the Biriyaani. How was the-- huh, did you like the girl?

SAARISH
Yes. I like her.
(pause)
I think, I like her.

SAATVIK
You think?...marriage cestukundaa.m anku.mTunnava?

Saarish nods.

SAATVIK
You must be joking? okka saare kalisaavu.

SAARISH
She seemed nice.

SAATVIK
One meeting and ...that's it?

SAARISH
mallee maTladataanu. Just one more time.

SAATVIK
(chuckles)
Just one more time?. re.mdu moodu saarlu maaTladithe extra bill veyaTaaniki idEmanna hotel lo exta sambara? pelli.
(pause)
You checked her compatibility score with Fraudector?

SAARISH

SAATVIK

SAARISH
teleedu kaani vinaTaaniki baagundi kada.

SAATVIK
ashidda kooda vinaTaaniki baane untadi. But you don't want that name. Right?

Saarish clearly doesn't understand what Ashidda means. He is from Hyderabad.

SAATVIK

SAARISH
nenu pustakaalu coodataaniki vellaledu pillanu coodaTaaniki vellaanu.

Saatvik sighs.

SAATVIK
Let's put our own application to a good use. We'll check the compatibiliy profile.

As they walk towards a conference room.

## As Saatvik checks Lalana's details, Kunthi interrupts for daily meeting.

INT. FRAUDECTOR OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

Screen filled with Fraudector's logo as the application launches.  

Saatvik types 'Lalana' into Fraudector, their application. The software auto suggests a list of names starting with Lalana.

SAATVIK
Lalana...Gundepidi...?

Saarish nods.

SAARISH
(looking at her thumbnail)
She is pretty.

SAATVIK
mana algorithm em ceputu.mdo coodda.m.

As he enters "Saarish Govardan" into the application, the door opens. KUNTHI(35) walks in. It's the woman from the newspaper article we saw earlier on the wall. He quickly closes the application.

KUNTHI
Hello, my dear fellow developers.

SAATVIK
Morning Kunthi.

She nods. Waits for Saarish to greet her but none comes along. There is no love lost between them.

KUNTHI
Hello Saarish. Welcome back.

SAARISH
eM kaavAli?

KUNTHI
We have our daily team meeting? Now.

SAARISH
ayi pOyaaka uttara.m raaya.mDi.

He was about to step out, Saatvik holds him by the sleeve.

Three employees, DEVANAND, UDAYA and MURTHY hurry in. Kunthi glares at them, taps her iWatch -- *you're late.* 

They murmer apologies.

KUNTHI
Time means time. Daily meeting time telusu. ayina late gaa vastaaru. Indians kasalu time sense u.mDadu---

Saarish rolls his eyes.

SAARISH
-- modaleDadaama ?

## First standup.

INT. FRAUDECTOR OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

Fraudector engineering team of six -- Saatvik, Saarish, UDAYA, MURTHY, DEVANAND and Kunthi -- stand in a circle.

SAATVIK
I am resolving a connection dropping issue with Saarish.

KUNTHI
Saarish?

SAARISH
(finger guns to Saatvik)
ceppaDuga.

Pause.

KUNTHI
Murthy?

MURTHY

SAARISH

Kunthi sushes him.

KUNTHI

UDAYA

SAARISH
Grid? em grid? Who don't have a grid.

DEVANAND

SAARISH

KUNTHI

Saarish raises her hand.

SAARISH
maa paychecks sangathe.mTi? rendu nella salaries raaledu.

KUNTHI
Daily team meeting purpose, development progress discuss ceyaDaaniki maatramE. Okay? We are done for today.

Kunthi leaves and the rest of the team follows.

Saatvik closes the door behind them.

SAARISH
asalu nuvvu nannu ee company ki rammani elA voppincAv?

SAATVIK
Just let her feel that she is in control.

## Saatvik argues that best friend is not a soul mate.

Saatvik re-launches their app, enters Saarish and Lalana's name into the Fraudector application and clicks on test compatibility.

Colored lines animate on the computer as the application pulls data from various social networks and sources.

BRAYS like a donkey.

SAATVIK
Sorry. mI iddaru total mismatch.

It spits out a matrix with a verdict of total mismatch.

SAARISH
idi tappu.

SAATVIK
code manamE raasAmu. algorithm manam develop cesiMdE.

SAARISH
compatibility matrix open ceyi.

Saarish clicks on the details button. Many 'right-compatible' marks and a few 'incompatible' marks.

SAARISH
cUDu. We have so many things in common.

Saatvik shakes his head.

SAATVIK
commonalities meeda focus ceyada.m mistake.  differences meeda focus ceyaali. thousand things common undoccu. okka difference u.Mte caalu. That one crucial difference will make all the difference. aa Nizamabad news cadivaava?

Saarish shakes his head.

SAARISH

SAATVIK

Saarish shakes his head.

SAATVIK
The moral of the story is --

SAARISH
bhaaryanu vadilEsi vellaku. vellina driver nu peTTukoku.

SAATVIK
One offending virus will make you sick. One offending program can bring the entire computer down. One offending infinite loop will make the computer unusable. One offending coalition partner will bring down a government. One bad actor can ruin--

SAARISH
You made your point but this is different.

SAATVIK
ee application enduku develop cEsaam? alaanTi mistakes mu.mdu mu.mdu raaku.mda mu.mde compatibility check cesukovaccani.

SAARISH
Yea, but we have so much in common.

SAATVIK
(quiet, almost talking his thoughts aloud)
anni common u.mTe, atmost best friend avuddi. wife kaadu.

## Saatvik's reluctance to move-in idea.

INT. SAATVIK'S HOME - BACK PORCH - NIGHT

Saatvik and Prema sit in the moon light holding beers in their hands.

PREMA

PREMA

He gets up.

SAATVIK

She shakes her head.

# Second Act - After learning that she got fired, Saatvik puts off breaking to Prema. 

## Prema mistakes Latha for pregnant.

INT. CLUB HOUSE - RACQUETBALL COURT - DAY

Racquetball ricochets across the walls.

Sweat drenched Prema plays alone but works her ass off. She hits a return shot with a loud grunt.  

Hears a knock on the glass wall. She turns. In workout clothes, two women, NITHYA(30's) and LATHA(20's) wait outside. Nithya points to the clock. Prema goes easy on the next shot. Winds up her game and comes out.

Latha is on the fat side with a pot belly. Nithya is very traditional with Sindhoor on her hair.

PREMA
naa tarvaata evaru lEranukunna aDestunna.

LATHA
No problem. baaga aaDutunnav.

As Prema sips water.

PREMA

LATHA
(confused)

Prema is obvlious to her confusion.

PREMA

PREMA

NITHYA

PREMA
Oh.

NITHYA
(pointing)

Nithya laughs at Latha.

An embarrassed Latha runs out.

PREMA
ayyo.

NITHYA
(proud)
naaku one year back delivery ayyindi. pregnancy fat complete ga pogotta. Do you want to play? I am Nithya BTW.

Prema stares out at where Latha left.

### TODO - Demoing it to clients; Comedy predicting. Neeraj trip. Funding questions. Tight budget.

## Saatvik and Saarish are the last one to leave the office.

INT. FRAUDECTOR OFFICE - NIGHT

Office is empty except for Saatvik and Saarish. They code in silence.

EXT. HYDERABAD - NIGHT

It's late in the night. Youngsters clamor for tiffins at vending carts.

INT. FRAUDECTOR OFFICE - NIGHT

Saarish watches with a dour face as Saatvik gets up, slings his backpack and walks to the exit door holding the open laptop in one hand and types..

Saarish turns off the lights and waits by the door.

Saatvik folds his laptop, puts it in the bag and smiles at Saarish.

They close the door and exit the office.

## Saatvik asks Saarish to attend the workshop. Saarish tells that Lalana gave her number

EXT. FRAUDECTOR OFFICE - NIGHT

As they walk.

Saarish extends his phone to Saatvik.

SAARISH

Saatvik whistles.

SAATVIK
Nice. Call cestaava mari?

Saarish shrugs - of course!

SAATVIK
nEnu ceppiMdi gurtuMdi ga. Relationship breakers meeda focus ceyi.

## Saatvik burns midnight oil; lies to prema if he has eaten.

INT. SAATVIK'S HOME - NIGHT

Dinner is set on the dining table. Saatvik dressed in pajama's picks up just a papad from a container and munches on it.

As he heads to his home office, phone rings. From Prema.

He sits infront of the computer.

INT. SAATVIK'S HOME - HOME OFFICE - NIGHT

Saatvik considers the code on the twin monitors. He looks like he is in serious thought, but...
...his head jerks into the keyboard, waking him up from his sleep.

He shakes his head and gets back to work.

## Satyamma cribs that Saatvik is not eating breakfast.

INT. SAATVIK'S HOME - MORNING

SATYAMMA(40's) puts the fresh breakfast on the dining table and collects the untouched dinner. She is Saatvik's maid-and-cook.

Holding his office bag, Saatvik beelines to the front door.

As he puts on his shoes.

SATYAMMA

SAATVIK

He shakes his head.

SATYAMMA

As he was about to exit.

He hands her the money.

## Saatvik drives to pickup Prema while listening to self help tapes.

INT. CAR - DAY - MOVING

Saatvik plugs in a USB jumpdrive into the car's aux.

A new age self help audiobook.

SAATVIK
I attract positivity into my life.

He drives through the thick traffic repeating the affirmations.

SAATVIK
I invite positive energy into my life. I become a vessel for optimistic thoughts.

## Saatvik picks up a waiting Prema.

EXT. PREMA'S HOME - DAY

Prema locks the door. She carries a handbag and a plastic mesh bag with food containers.

Saatvik pulls the car to her drive way.

As she gets in with her bags, he eyes at her plastic bag with suspicion.

## Prema forces Saatvik to eat breakfast in the car.

INT. CAR - DAY - MOVING

Prema takes out a box from the bag.

PREMA
breakfast ayyinda?

SAATVIK
Yeah. Of course. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Breakfast tinakapOte metabolism--

PREMA

SAATVIK

(off her 'I don't believe you' looks)
uh, uh...Dosa...Idli..Chutney. Saambar. All the good yummy, nutritious stuff. Satyamma baaga cEstadi.

Prema calls a number. She doesn't believe him.

PREMA
(into the phone)
Satyamma?

SAATVIK
naa pani manishi to maaTlADutunnAva?. You are not supposed to call her. There is...owner maid confidentiality.

Prema listens on the phone and hangs up.

She takes a spoonful of Pongal and extends to him.

SAATVIK

PREMA

Lists all the cons of Prema's personality - dominating, pushy, overbearing, aggressive, overconfident, do not listen, bossy - pretty much all synonyms.

She ventures to the source of rustling.

A COUPLE makes out hiding behind shrubs.

As Prema turns back to resume her walk, her phone dings.

As she turns a corner, she bumps into Nithya and Nitin with the baby stroller.

Seeing Prema, Nithya turns pale. She was about to take a detour.

PREMA
Nithya, I'm sorry for the off color joke. It was inappropriate. I shouldn't have said it. I am really sorry.
